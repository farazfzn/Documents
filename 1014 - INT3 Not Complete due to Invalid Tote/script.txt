
script to get actual tote :
select cntr_nbr from prod_trkg_tran where task_id = '199410276';


1st scenario:

-When u dont see any ilpn in activity tracking

-when the ILPN in activity tracking is in Putaway status

then we can update the status to 99 or 90

( pulled units is equal to allocated then 90)

pulled units is less than allocated then 99
